## (Intro SLIDE 48)
In our projects, we will produce a solution that will
  * be user-friendly and flexible and allows the user to specify goals and constraints regarding the operation of the microgrid.
  * consider all the economic factors regarding the operation of a microgrid, such as retail electricity tariffs and feed-in tariffs.
  * forecast microgrid generation and load
  * optimize the operation of PV panels, electric cars, battery and electric appliances connected in a microgrid according to user-defined goals and constraints
              
## Goals:
  * gain insights into the underlying dynamics of the energy management problem of your project domain
  * develop a notation
  * provide a mathematical problem description of the energy management problem of your project domain.

## You are expected to:
  * provide a thorough assessment of the physical aspects of your project domain. The physical aspects may include
    * resources
    * loads
    * energy storage resources (ESRs)
    * power electronics interfaces
    * power flows
    * powertrain
  * determine and provide the potential goals and constraints, including those specified by the user of our platform
    * goals
    * operational constraints
    * power flow constraints
    * power balance constraints
    * user-specified constraints
  * develop models that provide an abstract representation of the physical aspects and economic aspects of your problem, as well as their relationship with each other. The developed models need to be
    * comprehensive
    * general

Deadline: November 12, 2019
Deliverable: A slide set, and a 20-minute presentation of the slide set in class
Assignment constitutes 5% of the overall course grade.

## Presentation
